# Stock Analysis V2

This site can be found [here](https://stocks.jackrothrock.com).

## What is this for?

Every week I'll invest in a company, and over time I'd like to measure my ROI over time. I'll probably only invest in stocks whose strike price is below $20. Why? Because I'm broke, that's why.  

## Why v2?

I made a v1 a [while ago](https://github.com/jrothrock/stock-analysis-app) that sort of like this. However, the code is/was pretty bad, and so hopefully this time around it'll be a lot better. Also, I'm going to be testing some new techs I haven't used in the past. These include React, D3, Capistrano, and hopefully I can get some machine learning integrated into this somehow.
