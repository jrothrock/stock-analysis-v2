# Stock Analysis V2

The site can be found at [https://stocks.jackrothrock.com](https://stocks.jackrothrock.com).

## What is this for?

I created this to 'fake' invest in a stock every week and measure my ROI. Maybe in the future I'll add something to mark trades I actually conduct, but being a broke college student, I'll leave it as is. For now, I'll be staying away from options and ETFs.

## Why v2?

I made a v1 a [while ago](https://github.com/jrothrock/stock-analysis-app) that's sort of like this. However, the code is/was pretty bad, and so hopefully this time around it'll be a lot better. Also, I'm going to be testing some new libraries that I haven't used in the past. These include React, D3, Capistrano, and maybe get some machine learning integrated into this eventually. 

## For building
When it comes to deploying, the webpack npm file in node_modules/.bin has tos have the top line changed to where ever node is sourced. This can best be found by doing `which node`
